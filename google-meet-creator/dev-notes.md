Developer Diary: Google Meet Link Generator
Project Overview
Building a productivity tool that programmatically creates Google Meet links using the Google Calendar API. The goal is to help teams quickly schedule meetings without manually navigating the Google Calendar UI.

Day 1: Research & Setup
Initial Exploration
Goal: Understand how Google Meet links are generated and which API to use.

Key Discovery: Google Meet doesn't have a standalone API! Meet links are created through the Calendar API by adding conferenceData to calendar events. This was surprising but makes sense architecturally.

Resources Used:

Google Calendar API v3 Documentation
Conference Data Reference
Stack Overflow threads about programmatic Meet creation
Setting Up the Development Environment
1. Google Cloud Console Setup
I needed to:

Create a new project in Google Cloud Console
Enable the Google Calendar API
Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)
Download credentials.json
Challenge #1: OAuth Scopes
Initially wasn't sure which scopes to request. The documentation mentions several:

calendar (full access)
calendar.events (event-specific)
calendar.readonly (read-only)
Solution: Went with calendar.events as it provides the minimum necessary permissions (principle of least privilege).

2. Installing Dependencies
bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
Note: The package names are confusing! google-api-python-client is the main one, despite the generic name.

Day 2: Implementation
OAuth 2.0 Flow Implementation
Challenge #2: Understanding the OAuth Flow
The OAuth flow for installed applications involves:

Generate authorization URL
User grants permission in browser
Exchange authorization code for tokens
Store refresh token for future use
Key Code Decision:

python
flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
    'credentials.json', SCOPES)
creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
Using port=0 lets the system assign an available port automatically. Better than hardcoding port 8080 which might be in use.

Challenge #3: Token Management
First implementation kept re-authenticating on every run. Annoying!

Solution: Save credentials to token.json and check if they're still valid:

python
if os.path.exists('token.json'):
    creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json', SCOPES)

if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
    creds.refresh(Request())
This reduced subsequent runs to <1 second.

Creating Meet Events
Challenge #4: The conferenceData Mystery
My first attempt created events but no Meet links appeared!

python
# ❌ This doesn't work
event = {
    'summary': 'Test Meeting',
    'start': {...},
    'end': {...}
}
service.events().insert(calendarId='primary', body=event).execute()
Solution: Need TWO things:

Add conferenceData with createRequest to the event body
Pass conferenceDataVersion=1 parameter to the API call
python
# ✓ This works!
event = {
    'summary': 'Test Meeting',
    'conferenceData': {
        'createRequest': {
            'requestId': f"meet-{datetime.now().timestamp()}",
            'conferenceSolutionKey': {'type': 'hangoutsMeet'}
        }
    }
}
service.events().insert(
    calendarId='primary',
    body=event,
    conferenceDataVersion=1  # Critical!
).execute()
The requestId must be unique per request. Using timestamp works well.

Challenge #5: Extracting the Meet Link
The response structure is nested. After creation, the Meet link is at:

python
meet_link = event['conferenceData']['entryPoints'][0]['uri']
The entryPoints array can have multiple entries (video, phone, SIP), so I grab the first one which is always the video link.

Adding Attendees
Challenge #6: Email Notifications
Adding attendees was straightforward, but controlling notifications wasn't obvious.

python
event['attendees'] = [{'email': 'alice@example.com'}]

# Control email behavior with sendUpdates parameter
service.events().insert(
    calendarId='primary',
    body=event,
    sendUpdates='all'  # Options: 'all', 'none', 'externalOnly'
).execute()
For testing, I used 'none' to avoid spamming people.

Day 3: Polish & Testing
Error Handling
Added proper error handling for common scenarios:

Network failures
Invalid credentials
Quota limits (Calendar API has 1M queries/day)
Malformed datetime objects
python
try:
    event = service.events().insert(...).execute()
except HttpError as error:
    print(f"An error occurred: {error}")
    return None
Timezone Handling
Challenge #7: Timezone Confusion
Initially used naive datetime objects which caused events to appear at wrong times.

Solution: Always specify timezone:

python
'start': {
    'dateTime': start_time.isoformat(),
    'timeZone': 'America/New_York'  # Be explicit!
}
For production, you'd want to detect user's timezone or make it configurable.

Testing the Complete Flow
Created test scenarios:

✅ Basic meeting with no attendees
✅ Meeting with multiple attendees
✅ Back-to-back meetings (different requestIds)
✅ Token refresh after expiration
✅ Network error recovery
Everything works! The Meet links are generated instantly and are unique every time.

Improvement Ideas Implemented
Feature: List Upcoming Meetings
Added list_upcoming_meetings() function to show what meetings are scheduled. This helps users:

See all their upcoming Meet calls
Copy links without finding the calendar event
Verify the meeting was created correctly
Implementation:

python
def list_upcoming_meetings(service, max_results=5):
    now = datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'
    events = service.events().list(
        calendarId='primary',
        timeMin=now,
        maxResults=max_results,
        singleEvents=True,
        orderBy='startTime'
    ).execute()
    # Filter only events with Meet links
    return [e for e in events.get('items', []) if 'conferenceData' in e]
Additional Improvement Ideas (Not Implemented)
1. Automatic Clipboard Copy
Copy Meet link to clipboard automatically after creation:

python
import pyperclip
pyperclip.copy(meeting['meet_link'])
2. Email Integration
Send email with meeting details using SendGrid or Gmail API:

Subject: "[Meeting Invite] {title}"
Body: Include Meet link, calendar link, and agenda
Automatically cc: all attendees
3. Recurring Meetings
Support recurring meetings with recurrence rules:

python
event['recurrence'] = ['RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=10']
4. Calendar Selection
Allow creating meetings on different calendars (work vs personal):

python
calendars = service.calendarList().list().execute()
# Let user choose which calendar
5. Meeting Templates
Predefined templates for common meetings:

"Quick Sync" (15 min, no agenda)
"Weekly Standup" (30 min, recurring)
"Client Demo" (1 hour, with description template)

Lessons Learned
Technical Insights
Google Meet ≠ Separate API: Meet is integrated into Calendar, not standalone
conferenceDataVersion parameter is required: Easy to miss in docs
Token refresh is automatic: The library handles it gracefully
requestId must be unique: Use timestamps or UUIDs
Best Practices
Minimize OAuth scope requests: Only ask for what you need
Store tokens securely: Never commit token.json to git
Handle errors gracefully: Network issues are common
Test with personal calendar first: Avoid spamming others
What I'd Do Differently
Start with the official Python quickstart instead of diving into raw docs
Set up proper logging earlier (print statements get messy)
Create unit tests from the beginning
Document the OAuth flow with diagrams
Performance Notes
Token refresh: ~500ms
Event creation: ~800ms average
Listing events: ~600ms for 10 events
Cold start (first auth): ~3-5 seconds (browser interaction)
Security Considerations
Critical: Never Commit Secrets
Added to .gitignore:

credentials.json
token.json
*.pyc
__pycache__/
OAuth Best Practices
Used "Desktop app" OAuth client type (not "Web app")
Tokens expire after 7 days of inactivity
Refresh tokens are long-lived but revocable
Users can revoke access at: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
Production Recommendations
Store tokens in encrypted database, not JSON files
Implement proper user session management
Use environment variables for sensitive config
Add rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
Implement proper logging and monitoring
Common Errors & Solutions
Error: "Invalid Grant"
Cause: Token expired or revoked
Solution: Delete token.json and re-authenticate

Error: "Calendar API has not been enabled"
Cause: Forgot to enable API in Google Cloud Console
Solution: Go to API Library → Enable Calendar API

Error: "Redirect URI mismatch"
Cause: OAuth client type mismatch
Solution: Use "Desktop app" type, not "Web application"

Error: "No Meet link in response"
Cause: Forgot conferenceDataVersion=1
Solution: Always pass this parameter to events().insert()

Error: "Insufficient Permission"
Cause: Wrong OAuth scope requested
Solution: Need at least calendar.events scope

 Implement proper user authentication (not just service account)
 Add database for storing user tokens
 Create REST API endpoints (FastAPI/Flask)
 Build frontend UI (React/Vue)
 Add webhook support for calendar updates
 Implement rate limiting
 Add analytics/logging (Sentry, LogRocket)
 Write comprehensive tests (pytest)
 Create CI/CD pipeline
 Add monitoring and alerting
 Document API with OpenAPI/Swagger
 Security audit
 Load testing
 Privacy policy and terms of service
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how developers can integrate Google Meet creation into their own tools using the Calendar API. The key insight is that Meet links are a feature of calendar events, not a standalone service.

The most challenging aspects were:

Understanding the OAuth flow
Finding the right API parameters (conferenceDataVersion)
Proper error handling and token management
The most rewarding aspect was seeing the Meet link generated instantly and being able to join it immediately from the console output.

Next Steps for Learners
Try creating a web interface with Flask
Add support for recurring meetings
Integrate with Slack to post Meet links to channels
Build a browser extension for one-click Meet creation
Add calendar conflict detection
